Project Overview
This project is a web-based application that allows users to interact with an AI assistant to get information about different countries. The frontend displays a list of countries with their relevant details such as capital, currency, and languages. The user can also initiate a chat with an AI assistant to ask for more detailed information about a specific country. The backend is powered by OpenAI's LLaMA model to generate AI responses based on user queries.
